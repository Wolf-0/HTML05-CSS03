Lidakz One is a sharp, energetic graffiti font with a raw, hand-cut feeling.

The letters are built from angular strokes with pointed terminals and uneven rhythm. It has a street edge, keeping the shapes readable while aggressive and playful. The character set carries a steady tension, as if each letter is slightly braced, giving words a compact and back-leaning presence.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Designed by Mans Greback, Lidakz One explores hard shapes and controlled chaos.
